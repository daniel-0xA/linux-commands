How do I list all binary executable files recursively within a directory?

I use find command like this:

find /mydir/mysubdir -executable -type f
All executable files are listed (excluding directory), and including executable script file (like script.sh, etc). What I want to do is list only binary executable files.


find -type f -executable -exec file -i '{}' \; | grep 'x-executable; charset=binary'/wiki/Linux_I/O_Performance_Messungen_mit_iostat
